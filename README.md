- Strawberry Liquorice DBUG Card for displaying UEFI POST codes for Raspberry Pi Windows
```
Currently in Prototype Phase and as yet untested, but the theory is that 7-Segment Displays \
can be connected directly to GPIO pins without an I2C Microcontroller for easier debugging \
from a baremetal setting such as [pftf-rpi4](https://github.com/pftf/rpi4) UEFI. POST codes are arbitrary at this point.
